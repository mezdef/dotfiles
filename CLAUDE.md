# Dotfiles

GNU Stow-managed dotfiles. Each top-level directory is a stow package that symlinks into `$HOME`.
`.stowrc` sets `--target=~/`. From the repo root: `stow <package>`.

See `README.md` for the package inventory and the `.local` override pattern.

## Kanata (keyboard remapping)

Handles home row mods, hyper key, spotlight remap, and scroll bindings. Config is `.kbd` files
in `kanata/.config/kanata/`.

**To edit:** modify `.kbd` files, then restart kanata: `sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/com.jtroo.kanata`

Key files (all included from `kanata.kbd`):
- `kanata.kbd` — entry point, defcfg, defsrc, includes
- `hyper.kbd` — caps lock → hyper (ctrl+opt+cmd), tap → esc
- `home-row-mods.kbd` — per-finger timing, typing layer, spotlight
- `layers.kbd` — `deflayermap` blocks for every layer; one file per layer name
- `scroll.kbd` — page up/down and top/bottom bindings

Not stowed (excluded via `kanata/.stow-local-ignore`): `README.md`, `scripts/`, and the plists.
- `com.jtroo.kanata.plist` — LaunchDaemon, installed to `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` via
  `sudo ./kanata/scripts/install-daemon.sh`
- `com.jtroo.kanata-watcher.plist` — restarts kanata when a keyboard is connected
- `com.jtroo.kanata-restarter.plist` — runs `scripts/restart-kanata.sh`

See `kanata/README.md` for setup, daemon management, and rollback.

## Karabiner

**Not used for remapping** — kanata does that. Karabiner-Elements must stay installed only
because kanata depends on its **Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice** driver. The package
exists to preserve `karabiner.json` so Karabiner doesn't prompt for setup on launch.

Do not add remapping rules here. See `karabiner/README.md`.

## Zsh

`~/.zshenv` sets `ZDOTDIR=$HOME/.config/zsh`; everything else lives under `zsh/.config/zsh/`.

- `.zprofile` — login shell, PATH and exported env
- `.zshrc` — interactive shell: plugins, keybinds, tool inits, aliases
- `prompt.zsh` — prompt symbol, directory, cmd duration, vi-mode cursor
- `theme.zsh` — catppuccin colors, sourced by `prompt.zsh` and others
- `jj.zsh` — `jjw` workspace helper

Tool inits go through `_cache_init` (`.zshrc:31`), which caches a tool's init output to
`~/.cache/zsh/` so subsequent shells source a file instead of forking the command. Adding a
tool init without it costs ~10ms per shell. `rr` clears the cache and reloads.

## Atuin (shell history)

Config: `atuin/.config/atuin/config.toml`. Initialized at `.zshrc:193` with
`--disable-up-arrow`; bound to ctrl-r for both viins and vicmd.

The history database and sync key live in `~/.local/share/atuin/` and are deliberately **not**
version-controlled — `key` is a secret and `history.db` is machine state.

## Ghostty (terminal)

Config: `ghostty/.config/ghostty/config`. Includes keybind remaps for tmux compatibility
(ctrl+/, ctrl+\, ctrl+backspace send specific byte sequences).

## Tmux

Config: `tmux/.config/tmux/tmux.conf`. Prefix-less keybindings for common actions (splits,
copy mode, plugins). Helper scripts in `tmux/.config/tmux/scripts/`. Plugins are gitignored.

## Herdr (terminal multiplexer)

Config: `herdr/.config/herdr/config.toml`. Keybinds intentionally mirror `tmux.conf`.
Validate with `herdr config check`; apply with `herdr server reload-config` or prefix+r.
Plugins live in `herdr/.config/herdr/plugins/`.
