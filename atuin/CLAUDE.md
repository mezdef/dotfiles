# Atuin (shell history)

Config: `atuin/.config/atuin/config.toml`. Initialized at `.zshrc:193` with
`--disable-up-arrow`; bound to ctrl-r for both viins and vicmd.

The history database and sync key live in `~/.local/share/atuin/` and are deliberately **not**
version-controlled — `key` is a secret and `history.db` is machine state.
